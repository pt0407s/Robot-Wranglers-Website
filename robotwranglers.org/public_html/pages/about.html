                <div class="content-body">
                    <p>Robot Wranglers are more than just another robotics team. We might be new, but we started off strong, with big ambitions and even bigger energy. In our very first year, we dove straight into the BEST Robotics competition and made it all the way to Rookie State. That was an amazing experience, and now we're gearing up for our second year. But we're not stopping with BEST. FRC is the next challenge we're preparing for.</p>
                    
                    <p>What makes us different? We truly welcome everyone. Whether you're passionate about engineering, programming, writing, strategy, design, managing social media, or just enjoy solving problems with friends, you'll find a place with us. Our team breaks into subteams, so members focus on building and coding the robot, help with branding and outreach, or work on documentation. There's always something new to learn, and you'll discover your strengths along the way.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our mentor, Mr. Paschal, keeps us moving forward. With years of robotics leadership behind him, he helps us stay organized, safe, and focused. But the best part is he lets us take the lead. We make the important decisions and learn through experience.</p>
                    
                    <p>We're building more than robots here; we're building teamwork, creativity, and confidence. And this is just the beginning. We're excited to keep growing, face new challenges, and represent Legacy Ranch High wherever we compete across Texas and beyond.</p>
